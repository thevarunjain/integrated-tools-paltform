# Uniboard

The Uniboard is platform which enables the integration of 4 most common tools used in SDLC - JIRA, GitHub, Jenkins and Splunk. 

These are a set of various tools used for software development and project management in any company. The tools differ based on the stage of the development cycle, for source code and version control tools like GitHub and Bitbucket are used. 

The build phase involves usage of tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis CI etc. It is very important for the manager to keep track of the application development process, where tools like JIRA, Kanban are used. 

The last stage is the maintenance, each application generates logs during its build phase as well as production phase. The data from these logs are very crucial in determining the performance, security aspects of the applications, tools like Splunk, Sumo Logic are used for this purpose. 

In order to get information from these softwareâ€™s and tools, an individual has to go to that particular software web application and search for what he needs. An employee has to login to each of the software and navigates to different tasks. Logging in and navigating to what is required takes up some time. 

How good would it be if he finds everything, he needs at one single place and he does not need to spend time explicitly going to each of these tools and getting his task done? In order to address all such issues, we have developed a web application dashboard with everything integrated at one place. This is a single point of control for accessing basic information or doing basic tasks. If there is a requirement wherein the person has to use the extended application, the dashboard takes him to the main application.
